By this project, we intend to extend the capabilities of Apache Tika for its MIME Detection for application/octet files in specific
In the course of this assignment, we will be using BFC, BFD, FHT algorithms to generate model for files
based on their MIME type, using training data of the TREC Polar datasets. We will later validate those model and suggest
extensions in the Apache Tika MIME library.
